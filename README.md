# daily-planner

From this application, a user can simply add tasks they want to perform on a particular day.

Its a single day ToDo App.

The user is provided with a form where they can input:
  *Task Name - here they outline what task they want to perform
  *Description - here they can give a detailed summary describing the task
  *Time - a time input to enable user choose what time they intend to perform the task
  *Priority - a select input where they are able to rank task by priority. There are 4 items to choose from.. Priority1, Priority 2...
  
The App has been built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

A completed version of this application should be able to display the tasks with highest priority at the beggining of the list
Also for a better UI experience, the priority options should have like different colors to enable user distinguish faster which needs to come faster or is urgent than the other.

Also the time input needs to help us give the user a reminder sometime to the task or when its time to perform the task. Maybe we can also send a message to the user for reminder when its near time or when its time to perform the task.
